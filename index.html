             <p>Hi, I am Mario! I am from San Antonio, Texas and I have lived in Richmond now for 2 years. I started my professional career as a High School Social Studies teacher and a baseball and football coach. After doing that for 2 years I decided that I wanted to pick up and live in a different part of the country. Richmond had always been on my radar because I love being outdoors and there is so much to do here. The river goes right throught the city, the mountains are about an hour away, and the beach is only two hours away. So far I love everything about RVA and I can see myself staying here long term.</p>

             <p>After teaching, I found myself a job as a Project Manager for new hospital activations This job provided me the opportunity to travel all around the country, but I had chose to live in Richmond and I was rarely here. So after nearly 2 years of this job I decided to step away and search for a job locally. That is how I ended up becoming a Technical Recruiter. I have been working with Fahrenheit IT for only 3 months, but it has rapidly increased my curiosity in technology and web development.</p>

             <p>My goal is to complete this course and learn how to be a web developer. I am still unsure as to how I will use this knowledge upon completion, but I do know that these are very valuable skills to have in my arsenal. Technology is not going anywhere anytime soon and these skills will only make me more marketable as I move forward in my career.</p>
